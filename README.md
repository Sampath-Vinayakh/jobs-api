# jobs-api

- Developed a robust Jobs API using Express.js, effectively integrating it with MongoDB database to provide seamless job management and data storage capabilities
- Implemented a secure authentication system by working with JWT tokens, generating them upon user registration or login with valid credentials.
- Enforced stringent security measures by requiring a valid JWT token for all job-related requests, including retrieving job listings, creating new job postings, updating existing jobs, and deleting job listings.
